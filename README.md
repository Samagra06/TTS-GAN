# TTS-GAN
In this project, we address the common challenge of limited data in medical machine learning applications, particularly when dealing with time series datasets such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 
Conventional RNN-based time-series GANs have limitations in modeling long sequences as they fail to capture the long-term dependencies of time-series data.
Acknowledging the transformative capabilities of transformer architectures, there exists an untapped potential for their application in time-series GAN research, promising breakthroughs across healthcare, finance, language processing, and beyond.
To overcome this limitation, we propose TTS-GAN, a novel approach leveraging a transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of realistic synthetic time-series data sequences to overcome data scarcity challenges.
